    "# Lust\n",
    "# It’s funny how you move around the strange two-dimensional world, just for the sake of eating, eating and eating. Yes, the only reason you move is with this mysterious force to devour everything in the path. You can never get enough of it. In your life, there is always something more you want. That need never gets quenched. The game is a reflection of lust.\n",
    "# Eternal Dissatisfaction\n",
    "# Your lust never dies. You move from level to level. Your existence has no meaning. Your life is an endless rush into oblivion. You don’t realize what you have been missing the whole time. You don’t even dare to stop. Because if you do, the ghosts in your mind devour you completely. There’s always this dissatisfaction in your life that interrupts the harmony between your soul and the world outside.\n",

    "# Achievement\n",
    "# While life is chasing you and you are chasing the unknowns, there comes a point in life where you feel achieved. You feel you can conquer the world. You can triumph over the ghosts in your mind. That satisfaction of achievement ultimately boosts your inner pride; hence your inner peace is restored.

    "# Human beings rise on the giant shoulder of the knowledge that has been passed down from generations, so that the future won’t live like dead. The very books, scrolls, papers, that has powered the information pool of today is the key that our source of knowledge is enriched and well lived.\n",
    "# Gathering knowledge is good enough to make one’s life. However being “wise” is more than simply having knowledge. It is one thing to memorize the books and facts. However it is the wise thing to use those knowledge to drive the forces for betterment. Boxing up concept is good enough , but ability to think outside the box is greater.\n",
    "# (as In the passage by Bertrand Russell) The very example of nuclear outbreak is enough to make us realize the boundaries where knowledge and wisdom get separated as two entities. The creation of nuclear energy is from knowledge. However had mankind been wise enough, the atomic bombing would not be alive in the history books we read today.\n",
    "# The very core of every civilization may be the knowledge that powers it. However, it is the wisest words earned through experience of life and death that could have made humans a boon to nature.\n",
    "# You may know how to propose a girl (that’s knowledge). However it is the wisdom to find “true love and happiness”. He who refines the knowledge can seek the wisdom that was not sought. A person that has learnt the way of life and time may have wisdom because he/she has stood up from the mistakes that had been committed in the life.\n",
    "# “Knowledge is power, wisdom is light”, as I say.\n",
    "# We humans have developed and advanced so much through the knowledge that has been passed down from generation to generation, we are more informative and knowledgeable today than the people were in the past.

    "# Well, they are all knowledgeable, informative and can make you understand the concept of so-called world. You may have better information from the information-pool of tons of books and the internet of lies, there are few in million who are wise enough.\n",
    "# People in the past were much WISER than that of today. And it is not the matter of simplicity that defines the wisdom, it is much complex that ought to be. Life, death, self-awareness, experience, feelings, sense of priority, comprehensiveness, are all that summed up to refine a centered-knowledge into the wiser information for wisdom. We may have progressed in science, technology, health,etc through the infinite knowledge-pool we have today but we do not know much about how to teach wisdom. In the course of time, the wiser words had been abandoned in favour of personal or community improvements. Those awesome people of the past who learnt the hard way through struggle , experiences were wise enough to give you “revival” potion for your life, for humanity and mankind.\n",

    "# There are certain things in life which we should be able to embrace without hesitation. Life, as a child grows into a man and a man into a child, teaches us to be actionable, reasonable and handle the consequences no matter how harsh they are. Life bounds us into the never-ending cycle of “cause-action-result”. We are chained by the oaths of responsibility— some by society and rest by the family which we must be able to handle without any conditions. Perhaps, that’s what an unconditional life is.\n",
    "# I remember one of many events from my childhood where I had certain responsibilities the mis-result of which I was liable. One day during school, the class teacher asked if anyone could bring (buy) a broom to make the room clean— the price of which was given by the teacher himself. Since my parents had a shop, I raised my hand and he handed me a Rs 50 note without any commotion. I don’t know if that was “responsibility” but surely I was to blame if I lost that very money. Turned out, at the end of the day, I did lose the note. A sense of dishonesty might have been spawned if teacher had punished me but he knew the “kind of guy” I was — Innocent, honest and above all a child trying to learn the way of “right” and “wrong”. I don’t know if that was my very first taste of being responsible for the things I intended to do. But surely, now I know what I should and shouldn’t be doing from my own place.\n",
    "# Today as I write this, everything seems so dull. Tears rolling out from my mother’s face after ages and for the first time in my life I have really seen the true sadness within my sister’s soul. If there is something I should be able to handle things, it should be my family. Surely, I am responsible for the things I do and the bound that the society imposes me to do. But my responsibility has embarked a journey in itself from that lost Rs 50 to the present condition we are going through and there shall come a point in my life where I should be able to be responsible for my own child in the future.\n",
    "# If being responsible is to be a barrier between my family and the external world, yes I am responsible. If being responsible is to put a smile on the face of my family, yes I am responsible. If being responsible is to correct my parents for the wrongful actions they did, I am responsible. If being responsible is to not able to teach mathematics and physics to my sister, I am responsible.\n",
    "# Responsibility sees no age. Responsibility knows no time. Responsibility is something we have to embrace. Responsibility is becoming happy, becoming sad. Responsibility is fear. Responsibility is courage. Responsibility is vulnerable. Responsibility isn’t about having great power. Great power sprouts where responsibility thrives.\n",
    "# A child, slowly being manifested by the rules of the world. If that’s not responsibility then I guess I am not a human being. But that’s not true. I am responsible. Responsibility is me. Things are getting started and life is going to teach me, correct me.\n",
    "# Life is trying to get something out from me.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# A child inside a maturing soul\n",
    "# Being vulnerable in life is courageous. It teaches us how chain of events unfold slowly, piece by piece. Life unfolds itself to us and shows its true nature at unexpected times. We are not on the safer side no matter how “correct” things seem. At such times, life is merely a synonym to misery and failure. Such are the times when we feel free to cry, to carve up the emotions on our cheeks, to taste bitterness and to walk reluctantly with your meaningful aspect of “bravery”.\n",
    "# Today was different. I cried. All the dullness of not being able to do anything overpowered my soul and my willpower. It’s not that I am not a human. Even animals cry. But today was something else.\n",
    "# It has been ages since I shed up my tears. All the emotions I had suppressed were all lost at those times of childhood when life meant “struggle” and “pain”. I was raised in the sea of my parents’ tears, the taste of which I can’t really describe in these words I am struggling to write today.\n",
    "# We had struggled enough to not cry because humans cry when they are vulnerable. And today was something else. I still remember those salty water from my mother’s eyes — vulnerable, fear and hopeless. I know what it feels to live life “miserably”. To live with fear. To move towards an uncertain future. To live your life with one meal a day. To go to school without any money and schooling materials.\n",
    "# Today, as I was leading way for my mother I felt some nostalgic sensation. A child, all afraid and vulnerable, walking in his mother’s shoe. Little hand grasping the pains of a mother. Little mind believing in a distant, yet bright, future. And a curious little life pumped up by love. Those sensations were something I tried to suppress once we got onto the track of our own life. And now, same feeling have carved up the path for tomorrow. A grown up child giving hope to his mother. And in that very moment, I have found my very own world. I shouldn’t lose hope. I should be strong enough because now I have many lives to pump up.\n",

    "# Vulnerability and Life\n",
    "# We are most vulnerable during our high time or when we are feeling very low. It’s this point in life where we really get to know the real colors of life, people and the supposedly called \"loved ones\". It’s not that we can’t stand on our own, but we need someone we can trust and depend on. Someone who really understands the struggle you are going through. Someone who helps you unconditionally, without being selfish. Someone who picks you up when you fall.\n",
    "# Today as I write this, me and my family are in our low time economically. We had struggled enough in the past, the seed of which has sown a great philosophical life to me. Life, the perspectives of which, has embodied certain meaning into me. We had our seer of struggle in the past. But then my friend! Life always makes you vulnerable. So why now? Just when we were having certain stability, the uncertainty of which can't be denied.\n",
    "# I still remember those dark and cold days when we were near homeless. I still remember the warmth of my mother's lap even when she was feeling cold during those winter days. We didn't have enough clothes to protect us from the inevitable cold. The floors used to be cold back then and mother was the only warmth we experienced. I don't know if that's what life was and probably is - not having enough food, money and shelter.\n",
    "# Schooling was (and is) one of the important aspects for parents to their children. Seriously? How could I go to school where dreams are thrown away at a money's graveyard. Surely my parents didn't get proper schooling but they are one of the wisest of all. They couldn't afford the money for my proper education. But like any other parents, their hopes and dreams thrive on their children's proper growth. I was always fascinated by the miracles of words and books - I did wish to study for myself. To live a better life not for me but for my parents.\n",
    "# Schooling was also a struggle for me. Luckily my grades were good enough for getting scholarship. But those weren't the things that made schooling life difficult. It was to be not able to keep up with \"friends\". I didn't eat lunch not because I wasn't hungry, but lack of money my parents struggled to earn. Trust me, I was as hungry as every other people get. If Earth was like those edible house from a fairy tale, the Earth would have vanished. Schooling taught me the value of a proper education and money. Every occasional money I used to get ( Rs 5 worth of dried green peas), I'd save them in my little bank, the cracks of which used to fill wonderful imaginations I had of the uncertain future.\n",
    "# Such untold tales are many. My parents' diary is the living library for anyone who thrives to find meaning of life. The words etched from the tears and bloods still echo throughout my life. The pages of life still embark a nostalgic journey of a not-so-ordinary family.\n",
    "# As the saying goes \"a man values life when you strive him/her of food, money and shelter\". Now as I value life to its greatest endpoints, I am not certain why life has made me and my family vulnerable. Life is a combination of misery and failure at these times.\n",
    "# Vulnerability gets pronounced. Vulnerability surprises life itself. Vulnerability is courage. I am vulnerable. My family is vulnerable. Above all, life is more vulnerable than these words I have carved.\n",
