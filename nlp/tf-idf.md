# tf-idf
Implementation of term frequency - inverse document frequency

----------

## What is tf-idf ?
Tf-idf stands for  **term frequency - inverse document frequency** which is used in text mining and information retrieval system to evauluate how important a word is in a document.  

The importance is directly proportional to the number of times a word appears in the document but is also weighted down by the frequency of the word in the whole corpus.

## Mathematically

**term-frequency (tf)** of a term/word t is actually given by:

`tf = (number of times the term t appears in a document ) / (total number of terms in the same document)`

**inverse document frequency (idf)** mesaures how much rare a term is throughout the multiple documents.
That is, more the rareness of a term, the greater we tend to value the rareness.

`idf = natural_logarithm[ (total number of documents) / (number of documents having the term t) ]`

Here, `natural_logarithm` is the logarithmic function with base **e**.

## Implementation
I have implemented a noob document tagger that tags the document with relevant **important** tags.
