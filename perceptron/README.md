# Perceptron 

Perceptron is the building block for a larger network (which is called neural network to be taught later). 
It is a blackbox that accepts inputs, processes them and gives out outputs (actually tries to predict them).
A perceptron, in fact, is just a crude way to simulate a single biological neuron.
We know, a neuron fires (or does not fire) based on its input stimuli. So, a perceptron is like that:  
```bash
input ---> process ---> output (prediction)
```
